# openjpeg-jna
This module is a JNA wrapper for the popular OpenJpeg (OpenJp2) library.
It allows decoding individual tiles from a jp2 file at different resolutions, and encoding images as jp2 files.

There is no specific or command line usage, since the purpose is to use it as a library in your projects.
